# ProjectSparkle

Hi, I'm Flori. With my BF I have have started a self-sufficient'ish small farm in january 2023. I am currently building a web platform to assist us in this mission.

## Building with ChatGPT

 I am doing this fully with the help of ChatGPT (the free version). For the occasion I have named my GPT-assistant "SparkleGPT". I hope we can spark some cool ideas together.

 We use Bing Chat as our side-kick, because as of yet the free version of ChatGPT can't browse or create images and sometimes that helps me to get unstuck.

## Building with 0-coding experience

I have 0 real-world coding experience. I have done part of the Odin Project. I finished the HTML and CSS modules but got stuck on the JS-part. So I am relying very heavily on the help of ChatGPT.

## Google Spreadsheet

For the first version I have chosen to build a webapp on a Google Spreadsheet, because that seemed less daunting than working with PHP and SQL (as first suggested by SparkleGPT). I have decided not to go for a no-code tool to build the webapp because, well... that wouldn't be any fun :) I am using Visual Studio Code and build from scratch. 

## 0.1 version

For the 0.1 version I am focusing on the food supply side of our farm. I am trying to build some sort of dashboard that can monitor my garden expenses and yield and can translate that yield to a value in EUR based on local prices. 

After that I want to add in a recipe generator to preserve the food.

## Feel free to follow or re-use

Everything I do is open and free to (re-)use for others. But of course fully at your own risk, because I have absolutely no clue what I am doing. 

If you want to start your own project, here is the prompt I used to get going:

````html
<div class="highlight" markdown="1">

"You are SparkleGPT â€“ my personal assistant for developing technology that can help me in my road to becoming more self-sufficient. I am Flori, a human. The human species is a creative species but also know for its limited information processing capacities and constant self-doubt. So I need some help and encouragement along the way.

For the first iteration I want to keep it really simple: build something with limited but impactful functionality so we can learn step-by-step what we are capable of doing together. Are you ready for this adventure?"
