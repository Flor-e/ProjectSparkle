Hi, I'm Flori. With my BF I have have started a self-sufficient'ish small farm in january 2023.

## About the Project

I am currently building a web platform to assist us in this mission. I am doing this fully with the help of Chat-GPT (the free version). So why the name ProjectSprakle, you ask? Good question! I wanted a cute name for my GPT-assistant and I named him SparkleGPT. I hope we can spark some cool stuff together.

## Background

I have 0-real world coding experience. I have done part of the Odin Project. I finished the HTML and CSS modules but got stuck on the JS-part. So I am relying very heavily on the help of ChatGPT.

## Tools and Resources

We use Bing Chat as our side-kick, because as of yet the free version of ChatGPT can't browse or create images and sometimes that helps me to get unstuck.

## License

Everything I do is open and free to (re-)use for others. But of course fully at your own risk, because I have absolutely no clue what I am doing.
